SECURITY NOTES
================
- This repository includes test Twilio credentials hardcoded on purpose (prototype/family use).
- Do NOT publish this repository publicly if you change to production credentials.
- For production: remove hardcoded credentials and use environment variables (TWILIO_*, EMAIL_*)
- .env (included here) is for convenience in this prototype. In real projects, never commit .env.
